# Hackathon Project Prompt: Decentralized Land Registry

**Role**: Senior Blockchain Full-Stack Developer
**Objective**: Build a decentralized application (DApp) for Land Registry and Management using

## Project Overview
Create `DataHaven` (or `LandRegistry`), a blockchain-based platform that prevents land fraud b

## Core Features & User Stories

### 1. Authentication & Roles
- **Wallet Connection**: Users must connect their MetaMask wallet to interact.
- **Admin (Contract Owner)**: Can add/remove Officers.
- **Officers**: Authorized personnel who can Register Land, Approve Transfers, and Resolve Dis
- **Public Users**: Can Search Land, View Details, and Raise Disputes.

### 2. Land Management (Officer Only)
- **Register Land**: Input Land ID, Owner Address, Document Hash (IPFS/DataHaven ID), and othe
- **Transfer Ownership**: Update ownership records upon verification of both parties' consent.

### 3. Public Verification
- **Search**: Anyone can look up a Land ID to see its history, current owner, and dispute stat
- **Transparency**: Display all events (Registration, Transfer, Disputes) in real-time or via 

### 4. Dispute Mechanism
- **Raise Dispute**: A user can stake a small amount of ETH (e.g., 0.01 ETH) to mark a land as
- **Resolve Dispute**: Officers review the claim.
  - *Valid Claim*: The land remains disputed/corrected, and the staker gets their ETH back.
  - *Invalid Claim*: The dispute is cleared, and the stake is forfeited.

## Technology Stack

### Smart Contract / Backend
- **Language**: Solidity (0.8.x)
- **Framework**: Hardhat
- **Network**: Localhost / Sepolia Testnet
- **Key Concepts**: `struct Land`, `mapping(id => Land)`, `modifier onlyOfficer`, `payable` fu

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js (Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Modern, clean, "GovTech" aesthetic but premium).
- **Web3 Integration**: `ethers.js` (v6) or `web3.js`.
- **State Management**: React Context API (`LandRegistryContext`).
- **Icons**: Lucide-React.

## Design Guidelines
- **Theme**: Trustworthy Blue/Indigo palette, Clean Whites, Stark Alerts (Red for Disputes, Gr
- **UX**: Simple forms for Officers, clear "Connect Wallet" CTA, responsive dashboard.

## Deliverables
1. **Solidity Contract**: Validated and deployed.
2. **Frontend Interface**: Fully interacting with the contract.
3. **Demo**: Walkthrough showing a full lifecycle (Register -> Search -> Dispute -> Resolve).
